<p class="orange h2"><strong>Software development</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">------------------------</p>
<p>I have experience in building software using various languages and frameworks such as</p>
<p class="li"><strong class="red">Databases</strong>: MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB</p>
<p class="li"><strong class="red">Python</strong>: Django and Django REST</p>
<p class="li"><strong class="red">Node.js</strong>: Express, Adonis and Socket.IO</p>
<p class="li"><strong class="red">Java</strong>: Swing and JavaFX</p>
<p class="li"><strong class="red">Android</strong>: Java logic and XML interface</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also a poweruser of various software applications which include</p>
<p class="li">Wolfram Mathematica</p>
<p class="li">MathWorks MATLAB + Simulink</p>
<p class="li">National Instruments Multisim</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from this I also have a fair degree of in-field knowledge of setting up server infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some of my projects</p>
<p class="blockquote yellow">LecTut for Android - <em>Android</em></p>
<p class="blockquote">LecTut is the Intranet study portal of IIT Roorkee. My project was to build an Android app to provide a native experience to the users and make it easy for them to manage the course material on the mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote yellow">Nobel - <em>Node.js, Express and Socket.IO</em></p>
<p class="blockquote">Nobel makes it easy for IMG members to ping the lab and know who is present there. It allows IMG members to play a ring on a computer in the lab and then opens a chat between the caller and the lab occupants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote yellow">Amplio - <em>Django</em></p>
<p class="blockquote">Amplio is an app for collecting reviews and feedback and then debating upon that feedback in an infinitely layered Reddit-like discussion. It is written in Django and will hopefully be a part of Channel i, the Intranet portal of IIT Roorkee.</p>
