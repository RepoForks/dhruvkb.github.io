<p class="orange h2"><strong>Primary (St. Mary's)</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">------------------------</p>
<p>I was a brilliant student in school, always at the top of my class with grades over 95%, even touching 98.9% at one time. My report book is filled with 'very good' ratings in an assortment of attributes like discipline, class participation and exam marks. I am introduced to my first computer when I'm two years old and by the time I'm out of primary school, I know about the sound recorder and paint and a little bit of Microsoft Comic Chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="orange h2"><strong>Secondary</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">-------------</p>
<p>Still an excellent student, at the top of my class and grades still over 90% meant that I was born to study science. <em>Given that information, it goes without saying that I'm from India.</em> Lucky me, because science happens to be my favourite subject amongst all the subject one learns in secondary school. I do enjoy computers though now skilled in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Throw in a bit of MSWLogo into the mix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="orange h2"><strong>Higher secondary (Seventh Day Adventist)</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The golden years of my schooling where I excel at Mathematics, am terrible in Physics, enjoy Biology. The only thing that didn't change between then and now is my love for the subjects Computer Science and English. Computers are still my full-time passion and major hobby, sometimes even work. Literature is my liesure. I excel in my board exams with a score 0f 95.8%, defeating all my friends and competitors in the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="orange h2"><strong>Junior college (Jaipuriar)</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">------------------------------</p>
<p>My interests start shifting from Mathematics to Physics and Biology to Computer Science as I pick PCM+CS in class XI. Completing my junior college with 91.2% after the board exams of class XII, it is pretty clear what I like in life. Physics and Computer Science emerge victorious as my two favourite subjects. I start bunking lectures to spend time in the computer lab. I give the JEE and land a prestigious IIT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="orange h2"><strong>College (IIT Roorkee)</strong></p>
<p class="yellow">-------------------------</p>
<p>I study Engineering Physics at IIT Roorkee. My academic interest in Physics is coupled with my relentless pursuit of software development as a prolific member of IMG. I continue to enjoy learning the subjects I like. Here are the courses I undertake, covered under the B. Tech. curriculum of Engineering Physics at IIT Roorkee.</p>
